    "# Titanic Survival Prediction - Team Challenge\n",
    "# üö¢ Predict Who Survived the Titanic Disaster\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on passenger data like age, sex, ticket class, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Historical Context**: \n",
    "The RMS Titanic sank on April 15, 1912 during her maiden voyage after colliding with an iceberg. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Mission**: \n",
    "Build a predictive model that answers the question: \"What sorts of people were more likely to survive?\" using passenger data (name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Features**: \n",
    "- **PassengerId** - Unique ID for each passenger\n",
    "- **Pclass** - Ticket class (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class)\n",
    "- **Name** - Passenger name\n",
    "- **Sex** - Gender\n",
    "- **Age** - Age in years\n",
    "- **SibSp** - Number of siblings/spouses aboard\n",
    "- **Parch** - Number of parents/children aboard\n",
    "- **Ticket** - Ticket number\n",
    "- **Fare** - Passenger fare\n",
    "- **Cabin** - Cabin number\n",
    "- **Embarked** - Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)\n",
    "- **Survived** - TARGET - Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)"

    "## Challenge Rules & Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Limit: 20 Minutes ‚è∞\n",
    "Your goal is to improve upon this baseline implementation in 20 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metric: Classification Accuracy\n",
    "- Simple accuracy score (% correctly predicted)\n",
    "- Higher is better (max = 1.0 or 100%)\n",
    "- Binary classification: 0 = Died, 1 = Survived\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Requirements:\n",
    "1. Generate predictions for the test set (0 or 1 for each passenger)\n",
    "2. Create a CSV file with columns: 'PassengerId', 'Survived'  \n",
    "3. Submit to Kaggle for official scoring!\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/submissions \n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement Ideas (Pick 1-2 to focus on):\n",
    "1. **Add More Features**: Include Sex, Age, Fare, family size (SibSp + Parch), Embarked port\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract titles from names, create age groups, family features\n",
    "3. **Model Selection**: Try Random Forest instead of Logistic Regression\n",
    "4. **Better Data Handling**: Improve missing value handling, categorical encoding\n"

    "- Create **age groups** (Child, Adult, Elderly)\n",

    "- Better handling of **missing Age values**\n",
